Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

4nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 4 dashes for ranges (ex. "it's all in
chapters 44--44"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
